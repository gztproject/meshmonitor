# Settings

::: tip Reorganized in 4.0
In MeshMonitor 4.0 the old "Settings" tab was split in two:

- **[Global Settings](/features/global-settings)** — appearance, localization, security, notifications, backup, housekeeping. One per deployment.
- **Per-Source Settings** — connection, Virtual Node, auto-responder, auto-announce, auto-traceroute, auto-ack, scheduled messages, permissions. Edited in **Dashboard → Sources → Edit Source**. See [Multi-Source](/features/multi-source).

This page covers the **global** options. Connection / Virtual Node / automation knobs now live on the source, not here.
:::

The Global Settings page customizes MeshMonitor's appearance, localization, security defaults, and housekeeping behavior across the entire deployment. Open it from the **gear icon in the dashboard sidebar** (admin-gated).

![Settings](/images/features/settings.png)

## Node Connection Configuration {#node-connection}

::: warning 4.0 — moved to per-source
Changing the address MeshMonitor connects to is now a **per-source** action. Open **Dashboard → Sources → Edit Source** to change host/port, device path, BLE ID, MQTT credentials, or MeshCore config for any source. The previous single-node "Change Connection" modal has been replaced by the Sources UI.

The `MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP` / `MESHTASTIC_TCP_PORT` env vars only **bootstrap** the first source on a fresh deployment — after first boot, edit the source.
:::

See [Multi-Source → Connection Types](/features/multi-source) for the full list of supported source types (TCP, Serial, BLE, MQTT, MeshCore) and their configuration fields.

## Node Display

### Maximum Age of Active Nodes

**Description**: Controls which nodes appear in the Node List based on their last activity.

**Range**: 1-168 hours

**Default**: 24 hours

**Effect**: Nodes that haven't been heard from in longer than this period will not appear in the Node List. This helps keep the list focused on currently active nodes in your mesh network.

**Side Effects**: Setting this too low may cause frequently-active nodes to disappear from the list temporarily. Setting it too high may clutter the list with offline nodes.

### Hide Incomplete Nodes

**Description**: Filters out nodes that haven't been fully verified on secure channels. Incomplete nodes are missing proper name or hardware information, which on encrypted channels indicates we haven't received their NODEINFO packet.

**Location**: Settings → Node Display, and Filter popup in Nodes/Messages tabs

**Default**: Disabled (show all nodes)

**How it works**: A node is considered "incomplete" when it's missing:
- A valid `longName` (not just "Node !abc1234" format)
- A valid `shortName`
- A valid `hwModel` (hardware model)

**Why this matters for secure channels**: On channels with custom PSK encryption, NODEINFO packets (containing name and hardware info) are encrypted. If MeshMonitor can't decrypt a node's NODEINFO, we only see default values like "Node !abc1234". This means:
- **Complete node** = Successfully decrypted NODEINFO = Verified on the same channel
- **Incomplete node** = No NODEINFO received = May have just overheard encrypted traffic

**Effect**: When enabled, incomplete nodes are hidden from:
- Node List (Nodes tab)
- Messages tab node list and recipient dropdown
- Filter popup shows checkbox with secure channel recommendation

**Auto-behavior**: When filtering by a secure channel (custom PSK), the filter popup automatically enables "Hide incomplete nodes" as a recommended default.

**Use Cases**:
- Secure mesh deployments where you only want to see verified channel members
- Filtering out nodes that may have overheard traffic but aren't on your encrypted channel
- Reducing clutter from unconfigured or unknown devices

**Related Settings**: See [Skip Incomplete Nodes for Automation](/features/automation#skip-incomplete-nodes) to prevent auto-ack and auto-responder from responding to incomplete nodes.

### Unknown Nodes Filter

**Description**: Allows you to filter nodes that have no identifying name information. Unknown nodes are those without both a long name and short name, typically displayed as "Node 12345678" in the interface.

**Location**: Node List filter panel (identified by ❓ icon)

**Filter Modes**:
- **Show only**: Display only unknown nodes (useful for identifying devices that need configuration)
- **Hide matching**: Hide unknown nodes from the list (default behavior, keeps the list clean)

**How it works**: A node is considered "unknown" when it has no long name AND no short name (or both are empty/whitespace). This commonly happens with:
- Newly added devices that haven't been configured yet
- Devices reset to factory defaults
- Nodes that haven't broadcast their user information

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying unconfigured nodes in your network
- Cleaning up the node list to show only properly configured devices
- Finding devices that may need attention or setup

**Effect**: When combined with other filters, this helps manage large mesh networks by focusing on nodes with meaningful identification or highlighting those that need configuration.

### Device Role Filter

**Description**: Filter nodes based on their assigned Meshtastic device role, allowing you to focus on specific types of nodes in your network.

**Location**: Node List filter panel and Telemetry Dashboard

**Filter Modes**:
- **Show only**: Display only nodes with selected roles
- **Hide matching**: Hide nodes with selected roles from the list

**Available Roles**:
- **CLIENT**: Standard end-user devices (most common)
- **CLIENT_MUTE**: Receives messages but doesn't route
- **ROUTER**: Dedicated routing nodes
- **ROUTER_CLIENT**: Routes traffic and used by user
- **REPEATER**: Dedicated message repeaters
- **TRACKER**: GPS tracker devices
- **SENSOR**: Environmental sensor nodes
- **TAK**: Team Awareness Kit integration
- **CLIENT_HIDDEN**: Hidden client nodes
- **LOST_AND_FOUND**: Lost and found trackers
- **TAK_TRACKER**: TAK-enabled trackers

**Use Cases**:
- View only routing infrastructure (ROUTER, REPEATER roles)
- Focus on end-user devices (CLIENT roles)
- Monitor specialized nodes (SENSOR, TRACKER roles)
- Analyze network topology by node function
- Create focused views for network management

**Effect**: Helps organize and analyze large networks by grouping nodes by their functional role in the mesh.

### Ignored Nodes Filter

**Description**: Filter nodes that you have manually marked as "ignored." Ignored nodes are hidden from the node list by default to reduce clutter from nodes you don't want to track.

**Location**: Node List filter panel (identified by 🚫 icon)

**Default**: Unchecked (ignored nodes are hidden)

**Behavior**:
- **Unchecked** (default): Ignored nodes are hidden from the node list
- **Checked**: Ignored nodes are shown in the node list

**How to Ignore a Node**:
1. Select a node in the Node List to open its details
2. In the Node Details page, click the "Ignore Node" button (next to "Purge Data")
3. The node will be marked as ignored and hidden from the list

**How to Un-ignore a Node**:
1. Enable "Show ignored nodes" in the filter panel
2. Find the ignored node in the list and select it
3. In the Node Details page, click the "Un-ignore Node" button (green button)
4. The node will be unmarked and appear normally

**Use Cases**:
- Hide nodes you're not interested in tracking (e.g., nodes outside your area of interest)
- Reduce clutter in large mesh networks
- Temporarily hide problematic nodes while troubleshooting
- Focus on a subset of nodes that matter to you

**Effect**: Ignored nodes are hidden from the main Node List by default. They continue to receive data and can be shown again at any time by enabling the "Show ignored nodes" filter. This is a per-node setting stored in the database.

**Note**: Ignoring a node does not affect message delivery or network functionality - it only hides the node from the UI.

### Security Filter

**Description**: Filter nodes based on detected security issues, allowing you to focus on nodes with security problems or hide them from view.

**Location**: Filter Modal popup (click "Filter" button in Nodes or Messages tab sidebar)

**Filter Options**:
- **All Nodes**: Show all nodes regardless of security status (default)
- **⚠️ Flagged Only**: Display only nodes with detected security issues
- **Hide Flagged**: Hide all flagged nodes from the list

**Security Issues Detected**:
- **Low-Entropy Keys**: Nodes using known weak public encryption keys
- **Duplicate Keys**: Multiple nodes sharing the same public key

**Use Cases**:
- Security audits: View all nodes with potential security vulnerabilities
- Clean view: Hide problematic nodes to focus on trusted devices
- Network monitoring: Quickly identify new security issues as they're detected
- Compliance: Ensure all nodes meet security standards

**Visual Indicators**:
- Flagged nodes display a ⚠️ warning icon in the node list
- Messages from flagged nodes show a red warning bar with details
- Hovering over warning icons shows specific security issue details

**Effect**: When "⚠️ Flagged Only" is selected, the node count updates to show "X/Total" format (e.g., "8/156 nodes"). This filter works alongside other filters (text search, device role, unknown nodes) and applies to both Nodes and Messages tabs.

**Learn More**: See [Security Features](/features/security) for detailed information about security monitoring, detection methods, and best practices.

## Node Details Block

**Location**: Messages page, displayed when a node is selected in the conversation list

The Node Details block provides comprehensive information about the currently selected node, displaying real-time metrics and device information in an easy-to-read format.

### Information Displayed

#### Node Identification
- **Node ID (Hex)**: Node identifier in hexadecimal format (e.g., `0x43588558`)
  - Standard Meshtastic node ID format
  - Used in URLs and API calls
  - Matches the format displayed in the Meshtastic app

- **Node ID (Decimal)**: Same identifier in decimal format (e.g., `1129874776`)
  - Useful for debugging and database queries
  - Alternative format for different use cases

#### Power Status
- **Battery Level**: Current battery percentage (0-100%)
  - Color-coded indicators:
    - 🟢 Green: >75% (good)
    - 🟡 Yellow: 25-75% (moderate)
    - 🔴 Red: <25% (low)
  - Shows voltage in parentheses (e.g., "85% (4.15V)")

#### Network Quality
- **Signal (SNR)**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio in decibels
  - Color-coded quality indicators:
    - 🟢 Green: >10 dB (excellent)
    - 🟡 Yellow: 0-10 dB (good)
    - 🔴 Red: <0 dB (poor)

- **Signal (RSSI)**: Received Signal Strength Indicator in dBm
  - Shows absolute signal strength
  - Lower (more negative) values indicate weaker signal

- **Signal Trend** ▲/→/▼ *(New in 4.13)*: A derived "is this link getting worse?" indicator, distinct from the [Link Quality](/features/link-quality) score. It compares the last 24 hours of RSSI (or SNR, when RSSI history is too sparse) against the preceding 7-day baseline: **Improving** (▲), **Stable** (→), or **Degrading** (▼). Hover the badge for the underlying dB deltas. When the drop is attributable to a rising noise floor rather than the link itself, the tooltip calls that out explicitly. Only shown once enough history exists to say something meaningful.

- **Noise Floor** *(New in 4.13)*: The node's self-reported RF noise floor in dBm, shown alongside RSSI/SNR when the device provides it.

#### Network Performance
- **Channel Utilization**: Percentage of airtime used by all nodes
  - Helps identify network congestion
  - Values >75% may indicate overcrowded channel

- **Air Utilization TX**: This node's transmission airtime percentage
  - Shows how much this specific node is transmitting
  - Useful for identifying chatty nodes

#### Device Information
- **Hardware Model**: Device type with friendly name
  - Displays official Meshtastic hardware names (e.g., "STATION G2", "HELTEC V3")
  - Shows hardware images when available (70+ device types supported)
  - Hardware images fetched from Meshtastic web-flasher repository

- **Role**: Device role in the mesh network
  - CLIENT: End-user device (most common)
  - CLIENT_MUTE: Receives but doesn't route
  - ROUTER: Dedicated routing node
  - ROUTER_CLIENT: Routes and used by user
  - REPEATER: Dedicated repeater
  - TRACKER: GPS tracker device
  - SENSOR: Sensor node
  - And more specialized roles

- **Firmware Version**: Current Meshtastic firmware version
  - Displays version string (e.g., "2.3.2.d1e2f3a")
  - Useful for troubleshooting compatibility issues

#### Network Position
- **Hops Away**: Number of hops from your node
  - "Direct": Node is directly reachable
  - Number (e.g., "2 hops"): Requires intermediate nodes

- **Via MQTT**: Indicates if node connected via MQTT bridge
  - Shows when node is reachable through MQTT instead of radio

#### Location *(New in 4.13)*
- **Position**: The node's latitude/longitude as plain text (5 decimal places) — shown so a bad fix (e.g. `0.00000, 0.00000`) is visible at a glance without opening the map
- **Elevation**: The node's reported GPS altitude in meters

#### Activity
- **Last Heard**: When the node was last active
  - Relative time format (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago")
  - Uses your configured time/date format preferences

### Layout

The Node Details block uses a responsive grid layout:
- **Desktop**: 2-column grid for efficient space usage
- **Mobile**: Single column for better readability on small screens

### Missing Data

When information is unavailable, the block displays "N/A" for that metric. This commonly occurs when:
- Node hasn't transmitted certain telemetry data yet
- Information isn't available from the device type
- Connection was lost before all data was received

### Traceroute Path

::: tip New in 4.13
:::

When the selected node has traceroute data, the Node Details block draws the forward and return paths as a strip of node icons instead of two lines of text.

- Each node in the path renders as a role icon — a tower for a repeater, and similar icons for sensors, room servers, and companion devices — colored by hop count. Hop count follows your [Node Hops Calculation](/features/link-quality#node-hops-calculation) setting, the same one that colors the node list and map markers. A node marked unmessagable (it can't receive direct messages) keeps its usual corner badge.
- Each node's short name sits underneath its icon. Hover it, or tab to it with the keyboard, to see its long name, role, and node ID. The card also carries a **More Details** button that loads that node into the Node Details panel — with the keyboard, press Enter or Space on the node itself. Unknown hops offer no button.
- Arrows connect the nodes and show which way each path runs. The forward path's SNR values sit above the row; the return path's sit below, and its line is dashed. Hover or tap a link to see its direction, both endpoints, the distance between them (in your configured distance unit, shown only when both ends have a position), and the hop's SNR.
- A hop no relay identified itself for shows as a neutral "Unknown" placeholder rather than being skipped, so the path length stays visible. An SNR value the firmware didn't record shows as "?".

**Reading the overlap**: a node that both the forward and return paths pass through is drawn only once. That single icon is where the two paths meet.

**Reading a branch**: Meshtastic's flood routing doesn't guarantee the return trip takes the same path as the forward one. When it doesn't, the node(s) that only the return path visits drop to a branch row below the main one, with the return arrow routed through them.

**Choosing which traceroute to show**: when the node took part in more than one of its 50 most recent stored traceroutes — as an endpoint or as a relay hop (marked "relayed") — a dropdown above the strip lists them by date, endpoints, and hop count. It defaults to the newest. This is also what brings the strip to MQTT sources: they have no node of their own to run traceroutes from, so the strip draws from traceroutes the selected node took part in anywhere on that source's mesh.

**Statistical route**: on a Meshtastic TCP source, the dropdown gains a **Statistical (N routes)** entry when two or more stored traceroutes exist between your node and the selected node — all stored history for the pair, not just the 50 the dropdown lists. It merges every route into one diagram: each node and link fades by how often it appeared, so the relays your traffic actually depends on stand out at full strength while one-off detours fade back. Hover any node or link to see the exact count — "Seen in 12 of 16 routes (75%)". The aggregate makes no direction claim, so there are no arrows, no SNR values, and no copy links; pick any dated entry to get the single-route view back. Rare hops never fade below a floor, so they stay visible and hoverable.

The strip scrolls horizontally on narrow screens and uses a smaller size in the split-view side panel. Viewing it needs the `traceroute` read (or write) permission; requesting a new traceroute still needs write. The "last traced X ago" line and pending/failed badges describe whichever traceroute is displayed.

::: tip
This is separate from the Dashboard's [Traceroute Widget](/features/settings#traceroute-widget), which still shows the route as plain text.
:::

### Share a Meshtastic Contact

For a node with a stored Meshtastic identity, expand **Share contact** to create
a QR code and a `https://meshtastic.org/v/#…` URL. Scan the QR code or open the
URL in a compatible Meshtastic app to add the node as a contact without waiting
for another NodeInfo broadcast.

The contact preserves the node number, names, hardware model, role, public key,
licensing status, and messageability status available to MeshMonitor.
Unmessagable nodes can still be shared: that flag means the node cannot receive
direct messages, not that its contact record is invalid. Contact sharing is
separate from channel sharing, which uses Meshtastic's `/e/#` URL format.

## Solar Monitoring

**Description**: Configure solar production monitoring to visualize expected solar power generation on telemetry graphs.

**Integration**: Uses the [forecast.solar](https://forecast.solar) API to fetch solar production estimates based on your panel configuration and location.

**Configuration Parameters**:

### Latitude
- **Range**: -90 to 90 degrees
- **Description**: Geographic latitude of your solar installation
- **Examples**:
  - 37.7749 (San Francisco, CA)
  - 51.5074 (London, UK)
  - -33.8688 (Sydney, Australia)

### Longitude
- **Range**: -180 to 180 degrees
- **Description**: Geographic longitude of your solar installation
- **Examples**:
  - -122.4194 (San Francisco, CA)
  - -0.1278 (London, UK)
  - 151.2093 (Sydney, Australia)

### Declination (Tilt)
- **Range**: 0-90 degrees
- **Description**: The angle your solar panels are tilted from horizontal
- **Values**:
  - 0° = Horizontal (flat mounting)
  - 20-40° = Typical roof mount (varies by latitude)
  - 90° = Vertical (wall mounting)
- **Tip**: Use a protractor or angle finder to measure your panel tilt

### Azimuth (Compass Direction)
- **Range**: 0-360 degrees
- **Description**: Compass direction your solar panels face
- **Values**:
  - 0° = North
  - 90° = East
  - 180° = South (optimal in Northern Hemisphere)
  - 270° = West
- **Tip**: Use a compass app on your phone to determine panel orientation

**Effect**: When configured, MeshMonitor will automatically fetch solar production estimates every hour and display them as translucent yellow overlays on telemetry graphs.

**Visual Indicator**: Solar estimates appear as a yellow background on:
- Node Details telemetry graphs
- Telemetry Dashboard charts
- Any time-series telemetry visualization

**Side Effects**:
- Hourly API requests to forecast.solar (free tier)
- Additional database storage for solar estimates
- Minimal performance impact on graph rendering

**When to use**:
- Off-grid or solar-powered Meshtastic deployments
- Battery optimization and planning
- Correlating node performance with available solar power
- Predicting when nodes may go offline due to insufficient power

**Learn More**: See [Solar Monitoring](/features/solar-monitoring) for detailed documentation, API endpoints, and troubleshooting.

## Map Settings

### Map Click Zoom Gate

::: tip New in 4.14.1
:::

**Description**: The zoom level below which clicking a **crowded** marker zooms the map in first instead of opening that marker's popup, so you can pick the node you actually meant.

**Default**: 13 (range 0–18)

**Effect**: Below this zoom, a click on a marker that has another marker within ~20 screen pixels re-centers and zooms in rather than opening a popup. An **isolated** marker opens its popup right away at any zoom — crowding is measured per click, so a lone node on the edge of the map is never withheld. Set the value to `0` to turn the gate off entirely and always open popups on the first click.

Raise the threshold if your nodes sit close together and you keep opening the wrong popup; lower it (or zero it) if you mostly view a sparse mesh and want one-click popups when zoomed out.

**Location**: Settings → Map Settings

### Discard Invalid Positions

::: tip New in 4.13
:::

**Description**: Controls whether GPS fixes reported at **Null Island** (0, 0) — including precision-obscured positions that snap to that grid cell — are discarded or kept.

**Default**: Enabled (discard)

**Effect**: When enabled (default), a (0,0) position is dropped **on ingest**, across every source, and never stored. Disable it to store and display these positions as received — useful if you want to identify which nodes are transmitting bad/unset GPS fixes. Out-of-range or otherwise garbage coordinates (NaN, outside ±90/±180°) are always discarded regardless of this setting.

**Location**: Settings → Map Settings

### Map Tileset Selection

**Description**: Choose which map tile server to use for displaying your mesh network on the interactive map.

::: tip Per-theme selection (New in 4.13)
The tileset is now chosen **separately for light and dark appearance** — a **Light Mode Tileset** and a **Dark Mode Tileset**, each applied automatically when the matching color theme is active. Existing single-tileset selections were preserved for both slots on upgrade.
:::

**Default Tilesets**:
- **OpenStreetMap** (default) - Standard OSM map style
- **OpenStreetMap HOT** - Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team style
- **CartoDB Dark** - Dark mode map style
- **CartoDB Light** - Light mode map style
- **OpenTopoMap** - Topographic map with terrain details
- **ESRI Satellite** - Satellite imagery

**Location**:
- **Settings Tab**: Map Settings section (Light Mode Tileset / Dark Mode Tileset)
- **Nodes Tab**: Bottom-center tileset selector (visual picker) — updates whichever slot matches your current appearance

**Effect**: Changes the base map layer displayed on the interactive map. Different tilesets offer different visual styles, levels of detail, and use cases.

**Use Cases**:
- **OpenStreetMap**: General-purpose mapping with street and place names
- **Satellite**: Identify terrain features and physical landmarks
- **Topographic**: Outdoor deployments needing elevation and terrain data
- **Dark/Light**: Match your application theme for visual consistency

### Custom Tile Servers

**Description**: Configure custom map tile servers for offline operation, custom styling, or organizational branding.

**Features**:
- **Offline Operation** - Use locally hosted tiles without internet access
- **Privacy** - No third-party requests that could leak node locations
- **Custom Branding** - Organization-specific map styles
- **High Availability** - Independence from external tile services

**Configuration**:
1. Navigate to **Settings → Map Settings → Custom Tile Servers**
2. Click **+ Add Custom Tile Server**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: Friendly name (e.g., "Local Tiles")
   - **Tile URL**: URL template with `{z}/{x}/{y}` placeholders
   - **Attribution**: Attribution text for the map source
   - **Max Zoom**: Maximum zoom level (1-22)
   - **Description**: Optional description
4. Click **Save**
5. Select your custom tileset from the map tileset dropdown

**URL Format**: Custom tile servers must use the standard XYZ tile format:
```
https://example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
```

**Required Placeholders**: `{z}` (zoom), `{x}` (tile X), `{y}` (tile Y)

**Optional Placeholders**: `{s}` (subdomain for load balancing)

**Supported Formats**:
- PNG (`.png`) - Best quality, larger file size
- JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) - Good for satellite imagery
- WebP (`.webp`) - Smaller file size, modern browsers

**Validation**:
- Max 50 custom tilesets per instance
- URL length limit: 500 characters
- Name length limit: 100 characters
- Attribution length limit: 200 characters
- Zoom range: 1-22

**Security**:
- HTTPS recommended for production
- HTTP allowed for localhost/127.0.0.1 only
- Custom tile servers must allow CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**Example Configuration**:
```
Name: Local OSM
URL: http://localhost:8080/styles/osm-bright/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
Attribution: © OpenStreetMap contributors
Max Zoom: 18
Description: Offline OpenStreetMap tiles via TileServer GL
```

**Learn More**: See [Custom Tile Servers](/configuration/custom-tile-servers) for detailed setup instructions, TileServer GL integration, and troubleshooting.

## Elevation / Terrain (Link Profile) {#elevation-terrain-link-profile}

**Description**: Controls the digital elevation model (DEM) source that powers the [Map Analysis Link Profile tool](/features/map-analysis#terrain-link-profile) — the two-point terrain/line-of-sight/Fresnel-zone link-planning tool. Admin-only settings; visible under **Settings → Elevation / Terrain**.

**Fields**:
- **Enable terrain elevation** — turns the Link Profile tool's terrain chart on or off. When disabled, the toolbar button disappears from Map Analysis for every user and any in-flight request returns an explicit "disabled" message rather than failing silently. Enabled by default.
- **Elevation Source URL** — an optional custom DEM source. Leave empty to use the default: the public AWS/Mapzen "Terrarium" tile set (`elevation-tiles-prod.s3.amazonaws.com`), a free, no-API-key, SRTM-derived dataset. Treated as a server-side secret (like the Apprise API Server URL) — it's never sent to the browser except back to an admin who already has `settings:write`, since it may embed an API key.

**Source auto-detection**: the URL you enter is auto-detected as one of two shapes:
- A **tile-template** URL containing `{z}`, `{x}`, and `{y}` placeholders — sampled and decoded the same way as the default Terrarium source.
- An **[Open-Topo-Data](https://www.opentopodata.org/)-compatible JSON** point API — queried in batches instead of tiles.

**Test button**: probes the configured URL server-side and reports the detected source type, a sample elevation (queried near Mount Everest's summit by default, to distinguish a working provider from a source that just returns 0 for everything), and the round-trip latency — without needing to pick two points on the map first. With the URL field empty, it probes the default Terrarium source and labels the result "(default source)", so you can verify the out-of-the-box configuration too.

**Notes**:
- All elevation fetches happen **server-side** through the same SSRF-guarded outbound-request path used elsewhere in MeshMonitor — the browser never talks to the DEM source directly, and a custom source URL can't be used to probe your internal network.
- Elevation data is source-agnostic: it isn't tied to any particular Meshtastic/MeshCore/MQTT source, so this is a single server-wide setting, not a per-source one.
- Implausible DEM samples (below −500 m or above 9000 m — an artifact of open-water/void pixels in some tile sets, not real terrain) are discarded server-side and shown as gaps in the Link Profile chart rather than distorting it.
- The `POST /api/elevation/profile` endpoint used by the tool is public (unauthenticated) but rate-limited to 20 requests/minute per IP in production (requests from private/internal IPs are exempt); the Test button's endpoint requires `settings:write`.

::: tip Also powers the 3D terrain view (New in 4.14)
This same elevation source drives Map Analysis's [3D terrain view](/features/map-analysis#3d-terrain-view). A **tile-template** URL (the default Terrarium source, or a custom one) works for both the 2D Link Profile chart and the 3D pitched-terrain map. A **JSON point API** source only supports the 2D Link Profile — there are no tiles to build a 3D surface from, so the 3D toggle stays disabled with an explanatory tooltip for that configuration (no fallback to the default tile source is attempted).
:::

## Display Preferences

### Default Landing Page {#default-landing-page}

::: tip New in 4.2.2
Admin-only setting that controls where users land at the root URL (`/`).
:::

**Description**: Choose what every user sees when they open MeshMonitor at the root URL — the unified multi-source dashboard, or one specific source's view.

**Options**:
- **Unified View** (default) — current behavior; the multi-source dashboard with all sources side-by-side
- **Any configured source** — `/` redirects to `/source/:sourceId/` so the page opens straight into that source

**Location**: **Settings → Appearance → Default Landing Page** (admin-only — non-admin users do not see this control).

**Effect**: Sets a deployment-wide default. Users still have full navigation:

- The **Sources** button in any source view always returns to the unified dashboard
- The **Back to Sources** buttons on **Unified Messages** and **Unified Telemetry** always return to the unified dashboard
- If the configured source is later deleted or otherwise unreachable, the redirect falls back to the unified view

**Use Cases**:
- **Single-source deployments** — bypass the unified dashboard and land users directly on the only source they care about
- **Multi-source deployments with a primary node** — keep visitors focused on the main mesh while still allowing drill-down into others

### Preferred Node List Sorting

**Field Options**: Long Name, Short Name, ID, Last Heard, SNR, Battery, Hardware Model, Hops

**Direction Options**: Ascending (A-Z, 0-9, oldest-newest) or Descending (Z-A, 9-0, newest-oldest)

**Default**: Long Name (Ascending)

**Effect**: Sets the default sorting for the Node List on the main page. Users can still manually sort the list, but it will return to this default on page reload.

### Time Format

**Options**: 12-hour (e.g., 3:45 PM) or 24-hour (e.g., 15:45)

**Default**: 24-hour

**Effect**: Changes how times are displayed throughout the application in messages, telemetry, and other time-based information.

### Date Format

**Options**:
- MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., 12/31/2024)
- DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 31/12/2024)
- YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-12-31) - ISO 8601 standard

**Default**: MM/DD/YYYY

**Effect**: Changes how dates are displayed throughout the application.

### Temperature Unit

**Options**: Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F)

**Default**: Celsius

**Effect**: Changes how temperature readings from environmental sensors are displayed in telemetry graphs and node details.

**Side Effects**: Only affects display - the actual telemetry data stored in the database remains unchanged.

### Distance Unit

**Options**: Kilometers (km) or Miles (mi)

**Default**: Kilometers

**Effect**: Changes how distances are displayed when viewing node locations and calculating ranges between nodes.

**Side Effects**: Only affects display - the actual position data remains unchanged.

### Color Theme

### Telemetry Visualization Hours

**Description**: Controls how much historical telemetry data is shown in graphs.

**Range**: 1-168 hours

**Default**: 24 hours

**Effect**: Adjusts the time window for telemetry graphs showing battery levels, voltage, temperature, and other sensor data.

**CSV export**: Each graph (Node Details and Dashboard favorite charts) includes a download control that exports the **currently plotted** series for that metric — the same averaged points and display units shown on screen — as a CSV file. Solar overlay and paxcounter Wi‑Fi/BLE columns are included only when those series are present.

**Side Effects**: Larger values may result in slower graph rendering if you have many nodes with frequent telemetry updates.

## Telemetry Dashboard

The Telemetry Dashboard provides customizable monitoring of your mesh network with drag-and-drop widgets. Access it via the **Telemetry** tab in the main navigation.

### Adding Widgets

Click the **+** button in the dashboard header to add new widgets. Two widget types are available:

#### Node Status Widget

**Description**: A table widget for monitoring the status of multiple nodes at a glance.

**Features**:
- Displays Node Name, Last Heard time, and Hops Away
- Support for multiple nodes in a single widget
- Search functionality to add nodes to the list
- Sort by Last Heard time (most recent first)
- Individual node removal via the × button

**Adding Nodes**:
1. Click in the "Add node..." search field
2. Type to filter available nodes by name or ID
3. Click a node in the dropdown to add it
4. Repeat to add additional nodes

**Use Cases**:
- Monitor a group of remote nodes at once
- Track when specific nodes were last active
- Identify nodes that may have connectivity issues
- Keep tabs on infrastructure nodes (routers, repeaters)

#### Traceroute Widget

**Description**: Displays the last successful traceroute results to and from a selected node, as plain text.

::: tip
Looking for the icon-based traceroute strip instead? That's a different surface — the Messages page's [Node Details block](/features/settings#traceroute-path).
:::

**Features**:
- Shows the forward path (from your node to the target)
- Shows the return path (from the target back to your node)
- Displays SNR values for each hop when available
- Shows the timestamp of the last traceroute
- Supports a single target node per widget

**Selecting a Node**:
1. Click in the "Select a node..." search field
2. Type to filter available nodes by name or ID
3. Click a node to display its traceroute information

**Information Displayed**:
- **Forward Path**: The route your messages take to reach the target node, showing each hop with signal quality
- **Return Path**: The route used for return messages, which may differ from the forward path
- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: Displayed in dB for each hop when available, helping identify weak links

**Use Cases**:
- Understanding network topology and message routing
- Identifying problematic links in the mesh
- Comparing signal quality across different paths
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues with specific nodes

### Widget Management

**Drag and Drop**: All widgets (telemetry charts, Node Status, and Traceroute) can be reordered by dragging the ⋮⋮ handle in the widget header.

**Removing Widgets**: Click the × button in the widget header to remove it from the dashboard.

**Persistence**: Widget configurations (including selected nodes and order) are automatically saved and restored when you return to the dashboard.

## Settings Management

### Save Settings

Saves all changes made in the Settings tab. **Changes are not applied until you click this button.**

**Side Effects**: Settings are stored on the server and will affect all browsers accessing this MeshMonitor instance.

### Reset to Defaults

Restores all settings to their default values:
- Max Node Age: 24 hours
- Temperature Unit: Celsius
- Distance Unit: Kilometers
- Telemetry Hours: 24
- Preferred Sort: Long Name (Ascending)
- Time Format: 24-hour
- Date Format: MM/DD/YYYY

**Side Effects**: This affects all browsers accessing this MeshMonitor instance and cannot be undone.

## Danger Zone

These actions are **irreversible** and can result in data loss. Use with extreme caution.

### Erase Node List

**Description**: Removes all nodes and traceroute history from the database.

**Effect**: Clears the entire node database and triggers a node refresh to repopulate the list from the connected Meshtastic device.

**Side Effects**:
- All node information will be permanently deleted
- All traceroute history will be permanently deleted
- The page will automatically refresh after purging
- New nodes will be discovered as they broadcast on the mesh

**When to use**: When you want to start fresh, have moved to a different mesh network, or need to clean up corrupted node data.

### Purge Telemetry

**Description**: Removes all historical telemetry data from the database.

**Effect**: Deletes battery, voltage, temperature, humidity, pressure, and other environmental sensor readings.

**Side Effects**:
- All telemetry graphs will show no historical data
- Current node states (latest battery, voltage, etc.) are preserved
- New telemetry will continue to be collected normally
- The page will automatically refresh after purging

**When to use**: When your database has grown too large or you want to start fresh telemetry collection.

### Purge Messages

**Description**: Removes all messages from the database.

**Effect**: Deletes all channel messages and direct message conversations.

**Side Effects**:
- All message history is permanently lost
- Message search will return no results
- New messages will continue to be received normally
- The page will automatically refresh after purging

**When to use**: When you need to clear sensitive message history or reduce database size.

### Restart Container / Shutdown MeshMonitor

**Description**: Restarts the MeshMonitor container (Docker) or shuts down the application (bare metal).

**Effect**:
- **Docker**: The container restarts automatically and will be unavailable for approximately 10-30 seconds
- **Bare Metal**: MeshMonitor shuts down and must be manually restarted

**Side Effects**:
- All active connections will be disconnected
- The web interface will be temporarily unavailable
- Running background tasks (traceroutes, announcements) will be interrupted
- After restart (Docker only), the page should reload automatically

**When to use**: When applying configuration changes that require a restart, troubleshooting connection issues, or performing maintenance.
